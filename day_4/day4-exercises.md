# Section 1: HTML images

## In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?

  The `alt` attribute allows the designer to add a description of the image. This description should be fairly accurate for three reasons:
  * If the web browser cannot display the image, this text description will be displayed.
  * This text will be recognized by screen reader software and allow visually impaired users to better understand the content of the webpage.  
  * This text will also be used by search engines to optimize results.

  If the image is for aesthetic use only, the `alt` attribute should be added but the quotation marks left empty. 

## What determines if an image element is inline or block?


## What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
